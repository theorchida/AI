The two loss term in the SAE loss function have conflicting goals: the reconstruction term wants to make the autoencoder good at reconstructing the input, and the sparsity term wants to shrink the magnitude of the hidden layer. This means that even when perfect reconstruction is possible with only a single hidden unit activated, the sparsity loss will bias the magnitude of this hidden unit to zero, and the reconstruction will be worse.  \n",

To combat this, we add an auxiliary loss term equal to the reconstruction loss when we swap out the true latent activations for the preactivation values $\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})$.

The left histogram shows the distribution along a particular feature direction - the blue represents the distribution from interference when the feature is off but other non-orthogonal features are on, and the red represents the distribution then the feature is on. The distributions form a clearly bimodal pattern, and we can see in the figure on the right how a jump discontinuity (like the one provided by ReLU or by Gated models) can better model this discontinuity, by correctly reconstructing more of the interference cases (blue) as zero.\n",

Also, note that our toy model setup is slightly different from the paper's - we're using 5 independent features and so the \"X off\" distribution is down to interference from the other features, whereas the paper only considers a single feature and predefines an \"X on\" and \"X off\" distribution. The docstring should help you better understand what plot we're making here.\n",

However, you shouldn't have to do this to replicate the key result."

        "Another way to think about this is that our inputs $x$ have some element of randomness. So our loss function values $\\mathcal{L}_\\theta(x)$ are themselves random variables which approximate the expected loss $\\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\mathcal{L}_\\theta(x)\\right]$. And it turns out that even if we can't compute the gradient of the loss directly if the loss contains a non-continuous term, we can compute the gradient of the expected loss. For example, consider the sparsity term $\\|\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\|_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_{\\text{sae}}} H(z_i - \\theta_i)$ (where $z_i$ are the pre-JumpReLU hidden values). This is not differentiable at zero, but its expected value is $\\mathbb{E}_x \\|\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})\\|_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_{\\text{sae}}} \\mathbb{P}(z_i > \\theta_i)$ which is differentiable - the derivative wrt $\\theta_i$ is $-\\mathbb{E}_x\\left[p_i(z_i-\\theta_i)\\right]$, where $p_i$ are the probability density functions for $z_i$.\n",

The answer is that this expression is a form of **kernel density estimation** (KDE), i.e. it approximates the pdf for a variable by smoothing out its empirical distribution.\n",

These features are usually highly sparse, in other words for any given feature only a small fraction of the overall data distribution will activate that feature. It tends to be the case that sparser features are also more interpretable.\n",

To run a forward pass with SAEs attached, you can use `model.run_with_saes(tokens, saes=[list_of_saes])`. This function has similar syntax to the standard forward pass (or to `model.run_with_hooks`), e.g. it can take arguments like `return_type` to specify whether the return type should be loss or logits. The attached SAEs will be reset immediately after the forward pass, returning the model to its original state. Under the hood, they work just like adding hooks in TransformerLens, only in this case our hooks are \"replace these activations with their SAE reconstructions\".\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a lot of other ways you can do SAE-hooked forward passes, which parallel the multiple way you can do regular hooked forward passes. For example, just like you can use `with model.hooks(fwd_hooks=...)` as a context manager to add hooks temporarily, you can also use `with model.saes(saes=...)` to run a forward pass with SAEs attached. And just like you can use `model.add_hook` and `model.reset_hooks`, you can also use `model.add_sae` and `model.reset_saes`."

        "Automated interpretability is one particularly exciting area of research at the moment. It originated with the OpenAI paper [Language models can explain neurons in language models](https://openai.com/index/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models/), which showed that we could take a neuron from GPT-2 and use GPT-4 to generate explanations of its behaviour by showing it relevant text sequences and activations. This shows us one possible way to assess and categorize latents at scale, without requiring humans to manually inspect and label them (which would obviously be totally impractical to scale). You can also read about some more of the recent advancements made [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/) and [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8ev6coxChSWcxCDy8/self-explaining-sae-features).\n",
        "\n",
        "This scalable efficient categorization is one use-case, but there's also a second one: **SAE evaluations**. This is a topic we'll dive deeper into in later sections, but to summarize now: SAE evaluations are the ways we measure \"how good our SAE is\" in a varity of different ways. It turns out this is very hard, because any metric we pick is vulnerable to **Goodhearting** and not necessarily representative of what we want out of our SAEs. For example, it seems like sparser latents are often more interpretable (if reconstruction loss is held constant), which is why a common way to evaluate SAEs is along a **Pareto frontier of sparsity & reconstruction loss**. But what if sparsity doesn't lead to more interpretable latents (e.g. because of [feature absorption](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-feature-splitting-and))? **Autointerp provides an alternative way of evaluating SAE interpretability, because we can directly quantify how good our latent explanations are!** The idea is to convert latent explanations into a set of predictions on some test set of prompts, and then score the accuracy of those predictions. More interpretable latents should lead to better predictions, because the latents will tend to have monosemantic and human-interpretable patterns that can be predicted from their given explanations.\n",

        "For now though, we'll focus on just the first half of autointerp, i.e. the generation of explanations. You can download and read the Neuronpedia-hosted latent explanations with the following code:"

Subsequent work trained SAEs on the attention output of every layer of GPT2Small; these are the SAEs we'll be using in today's exercises.\n",

        "Functionally, these SAEs work just like regular ones, except that they take the `z` output of the attention layer as input (i.e. after taking a linear combination of value vectors, but before projecting via the output matrix) rather than taking the residual stream or post-ReLU MLP activations. These `z` vectors are usually concatenated together across attention heads, for a single layer.\n",

As well as a single attention head containing many latents, we could have a latent which is split across multiple attention heads. Evidence of shared attention head functionality abounds in regular models, for instance in the intro to mech interp ARENA exercises, we examined a 2-layer model where 2 heads in the second layer came together to form a copying head. In that case, we might expect to find latents which are split across both heads.\n",

        "Now, fill in the function below. You'll be testing your function by comparing the output to the dashboard generated from `latent_idx=2` (shown above). You should have observed that the top activating tokens are conjunctions liek `\" and\"`, `\" or\"` which connect lists of words like `\" weapons\"`, `\" firearms\"`, `\" missiles\"`, etc. We can also see that the max DFA token is usually a similar word earlier in context, sometimes the word immediately before the top activating token (which makes sense given the positive logits also boost words like this). In other words, part of what this latent seems to be doing is detecting when we're in the middle of a conjunction phrase like `weapons and tactics` or `guns ... not missiles` and predicting logical completions for how this phrase will end.\n",
        "\n",

        "We have the value vectors `v` of shape `(batch, seq, n_heads, d_head)` at each position. By broadcasting & multiplying by the attention probabilities, we can get `v_weighted` of shape `(batch, seq_dest, seq_src, n_heads, d_head)`, which represents the vector that'll be taken at each source position and added to the destination position, and will be summed over to produce `z` (the values we have before projection by the output matrix `W_O` to add back to the residual stream).\n",
        "\n",
        "It's this `z` (after flattening over attention heads) that the SAE gets trained on, i.e. `z @ sae.W_enc` are the SAE's pre-ReLU activations. So by writing `z` as a sum of `v_weighted` over source positions, we can write the pre-ReLU activation for latent `latent_idx` as a sum of `v_weighted[:, :, src_pos, :, :] @ sae.W_enc[:, latent_idx]` over all `src_pos` values. So for any given sequence `b` in the batch, and destination position `dest_pos`, we can compute the scalar `v_weighted[b, dest_pos, src_pos, :, :] @ sae.W_enc[:, latent_idx]` for each `src_pos`, and find the largest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reminder - `W_enc` is actually a linear map from `n_heads * d_head` to `d_sae` dimensions, so to perform this calculation we'll first need to flatten the values `v_weighted` over heads.\n",

        "Note, some of the src token indexing can get a bit fiddly. In particular, when you get the index positions of the top contributing source tokens, some of them might be within `buffer` of the start of the sequence. The `index_with_buffer` handles this case for you, because whenever the indexing values are within `buffer` of the start or end of the sequence, it'll just take the first or last `buffer` tokens respectively."

        "We'll now proceed through a set of 3 different methods that can be used to find features which activate on a given concept or language structure. We'll focus on trying to find **IOI features** - features which seem to activate on the indirect object identification pattern. You might already be familiar with this via the IOI exercises in ARENA. If not, it's essentially sentences of the form `\"When John and Mary went to the shops, John gave the bag to\"` -> `\" Mary\"`. Models like GPT2-Small are able to learn this pattern via the following algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Duplicate token heads** in layers 0-3 attend from the second `\" John\"` token (we call it `S2`; the second subject) back to the first `\" John\"` token (`S1`), and store the fact that it's duplicated.\n",
        "- **S-inhibition heads** in layers 7-8 attend from `\" to\"` back to the `\" John\"` token, and store information that this token is duplicated.\n",
        "- **Name-mover heads** in layers 9-10 attend from `\" to\"` back to any non-duplicated names (using Q-composition with the output of the S-Inhibition heads to avoid attending to the duplicated `\" John\"` tokens). So they attend to `\" Mary\"`, and move this information into the unembedding space to be used as the model's prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sadly, our SAEs aren't yet advanced enough to pick up on **S-inhibition features**. As discussed above, these mid-layer heads which read from & write to subspaces containing intermediate representations are pretty difficult to interpret. In fact, reading [this section](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FSTRedtjuHa4Gfdbr/attention-saes-scale-to-gpt-2-small#Introduction) of the LessWrong post analyzing our GPT2-Small attention SAEs, we find that the worst layers for \"% alive features interpretable\" as well as \"loss recovered\" are around 7 and 8, which is precisely the location of our S-Inhibition heads!\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the authors of that post were able to find **duplicate token features** as well as **name-mover featires**, and in the following exercises we'll replicate their work!\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we start, let's first make sure that the model can actually solve this sentence. To make our results a bit more robust (e.g. so we're not just isolating \"gender features\" or something), we'll control by using 4 different prompts: with \"John\" and \"Mary\" as answers flipped around, and also with the sentence structure flipped around (ABBA vs ABAB). The code below also gives you the `logits_to_ave_logit_diff` function, which you might find useful in some later exercises."

In the context of the IOI circuit, we look at the logit difference between the indirect object and the subject token (which we'll abbreviate as `IO - S`). For example, if a latent's output into the residual stream has a very large value of `IO - S` when we apply the model's unembedding matrix `W_U`, this suggests that the latent might have been causally important for identifying that the correct answer was \"Mary\" rather than \"John\" in sentences like \"When John and Mary went to the shops, John gave the bag to ???\".

Now, we can take this matrix and pass it through our unembedding `W_U` to get a matrix of shape `(d_sae, d_vocab)`, and then index into it to get the logit difference for each latent (or if we want to be more efficient, we can just dot product our matrix with the vector `W_U[:, IO] - W_U[:, S]` and directly get a vector of `d_sae` logit differences).\n",

This particular SAE was trained on the residual stream of the 20th layer of the Gemma-2-2B model, has a width of 16k, and uses a **JumpReLU activation function** - see the short section at the end for more on this activation function, although you don't really need to worry about the details now.\n",

        "\n",
        "Once we've found a latent corresponding to some particular feature, we can use it to **steer our model**, resulting in a corresponding behavioural change. You might already have come across this via Anthropic's viral [Golden Gate Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude) model. Steering simply involves intervening on the model's activations during a forward pass, and adding some multiple of a feature's decoder weight into our residual stream (or possibly scaling the component that was already present in the residual stream, or just clamping this component to some fixed value). When choosing the value, we are usually guided by the maximum activation of this feature over some distribution of text (so we don't get too OOD).\n",
        "\n",
        "Sadly we can't quite replicate Golden Gate Claude with GemmaScope SAEs. There are some features which seem to fire on the word \"Golden\" especially in the context of titles like \"Golden Gate Bridge\" (e.g. [feature 14667](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-2-2b/18-gemmascope-res-16k/14667) in the layer 18 canonical 16k-width residual stream GemmaScope SAE, or [feature 1566](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gemma-2-2b/20-gemmascope-res-16k/1566) in the layer 20 SAE), but these are mostly single-token features (i.e. they fire on just the word \"Golden\" rather than firing on context which discusses the Golden Gate Bridge), so their efficacy in causing these kinds of behavioural changes is limited. For example, imagine if you did really find a bigram feature that just caused the model to output \"Gate\" after \"Golden\" - steering on this would eventually just cause the model to output an endless string of \"Gate\" tokens (something like this in fact does happen for the 2 aforementioned features, and you can try it for yourself if you want). Instead, we want to look for a feature with a better **consistent activation heuristic value** - roughly speaking, this is the correlation between feature activations on adjacent tokens, so a high value might suggest a concept-level feature rather than a token-level one. Specifically, we'll be using a \"dog feature\" which seems to activate on discussions of dogs:"

Visit the associated [Neuronpedia page](https://www.neuronpedia.org/steer) to try it out. You can hover over the \"How it works\" button to see what the interpretation of the different coefficients are in the steering API (it's pretty similar to how we've used them in our experiments).\n",

        "Try experimenting with the steering API, with this latent and some others. You can also try some other models, like the instruction-tuned Gemma models from DeepMind. There are some interesting patterns that start appearing when we get to finetuned models, such as a divergence between what a latent seems to be firing on and the downstream effect of steering on that latent. For example, you might find latents which activate on certain kinds of harmful or offensive language, but which induce refusal behaviour when steered on: possibly those latents existed in the non-finetuned model and would have steered towards more harmful behaviour when steered on, but during finetuning their output behaviour was re-learned. This links to one key idea when doing latent interpretability: the duality between the view of latents as **representations** and latents as **functions** (see the section on circuits for more on this)."

        "These represent three different small modifications to the basic SAE architecture, all of which seem to offer improvements over standard SAEs. To address them each in turn:\n",
        "\n",
        "**TopK** SAEs use a different activation function: rather than $z = \\operatorname{ReLU}(W_{enc}(x-b_{dec}) + b_{enc})$, we compute them as $z = \\operatorname{TopK}(W_{enc}(x-b_{dec}))$, where $\\operatorname{TopK}$ returns the top $K$ elements of the input tensor, setting the rest to zero. This removes the need for the $L_1$ penalty (which tackles problems like [feature suppression](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes)), and allows us to set the $L_0$ value directly rather than tuning it to some specific value. It can also be composed with arbitrary activation functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**JumpReLU** SAEs use the JumpReLU activation function in place of a regular ReLU. JumpReLU is just a ReLU with an extra step, and (often learnable) threshold parameter, i.e. $\\operatorname{JumpReLU}_\\theta(x) = xH(x-\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is a learnable threshold parameter and $H$ is the Heaviside step function (equalling 1 when its argument is positive, and 0 otherwise).\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuitively, why might we expect this to perform better than regular ReLU SAEs? One reason is that empirically, seem to \"want to be binary\". For instance, we often see features like \"is this about a basketball\" which are better thought of as \"off\" or \"on\" than occupying some continuous range from 0 to 1. In practice reconstructing the precise coefficients does matter, and they often seem important for indicating something like the model's confidence in a particular feature being present. But still, we'd ideally like an architecture which can learn this discontinuity.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Gated** SAEs are the most recent (as of writing) variant on the basic SAE architecture to be proposed, coming from another recent [DeepMind paper](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/88147/). They offer the same jump-discontinuity benefit as JumpReLU (in fact you can show that with a bit of weight tying Gated SAEs are equivalent to JumpReLUs), but they offer one other advantage too: they **decouple the jump discontinuity from the magnitude**. With JumpReLU functions there's only one axis to vary along, but ideally you'd want the freedom to independently determine whether a feature should be on or off, and what its magnitude should be when it's on. Gated SAEs accomplish this by having 2 separate encoder weight matrices, one for computing magnitude and one for masking. Like JumpReLUs, they're also discontinuous and need a special training objective function, but unlike JumpReLUs they've generally proven much easier to train. From Neel's [Extremely Opinionated Annotated List of My Favourite Mechanistic Interpretability Papers](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NfFST5Mio7BCAQHPA/an-extremely-opinionated-annotated-list-of-my-favourite#Sparse_Autoencoders):\n",

Rather than using mean squared reconstruction error (MSE) of activations as the training objective, they use the KL divergence between the original output logits and the output logits we get when passing the SAE output through the rest of the network. The intuition here is that we want to identify the **functionally important features** which are actually important for explaining the model's behaviour on the training distribution. Minimizing MSE can be a good heuristic for this (because important features often need to be represented with high magnitude), but it's not directly getting at the thing we want to measure, and could be considered vulnerable to **Goodhart's Law** (\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\").\n",

This is better for the model's sparsity (because it means the \"starts with e\" feature fires on one less word), but unfortunately it prevents our features from being monosemantic, and prevents our SAEs giving us a decomposition into a sparse set of causal mediators.\n",

They don't actually learn to perform the MLP layer's computation, rather they learn to reconstruct the results of that computation. It's very hard to do any weights-based analysis on MLP layers in superposition using standard SAEs, since many features are highly dense in the neuron basis, meaning the neurons are hard to decompose.\n",

        "In contrast, **transcoders** take in the activations before the MLP layer (i.e. the possibly-normalized residual stream values) and aim to represent the post-MLP activations of that MLP layer, again as a sparse linear combination of feature vectors. The transcoder terminology is the most common, although these have also been called **input-output SAEs** (because we take the input to some base model layer, and try to learn the output) and **predicting future activations** (for obvious reasons). Note that transcoders aren't technically autoencoders, because they're learning a mapping rather than a reconstruction - however a lot of our intuitions from SAEs carry over to transcoders.\n",

        "Our work so far has focused on understanding individual latents. In later sections we'll take deeper dives into specific methods for interpreting latents, but in this section we address a highly important topic - what about **circuits of SAAE latents**? Circuit analysis has already been somewhat successful in language model interpretability (e.g. see Anthropic's work on induction circuits, or the Indirect Object Identification paper), but many attempts to push circuit analysis further has hit speedbumps: most connections in the model are not sparse, and it's very hard to disentangle all the messy cross-talk between different components and residual stream subspaces. Circuit offer a better path forward, since we should expect that not only are individual latents generally sparse, they are also **sparsely connected** - any given latent should probably only have a downstream effect on a small number of other latents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, if this does end up being true, it's a strong piece of evidence that latents found by SAEs *are* the **fundamental units of computation** used by the model, as opposed to just being an interesting clustering algorithm. Of course we do already have some evidence for this (e.g. the effectiveness of latent steering, and the fact that latents have already revealed important information about models which isn't clear when just looking at the basic components), but finding clear latent circuits would be a much stronger piece of evidence."

The `has_aux` argument allows us to return a tuple of tensors which won't be differentiated. In other words, it takes a tensor -> (tensor, tuple_of_tensors) function `f(x) = (y, aux)` and returns the function `g(x) = (J, aux)` where `J[i, j] = d(f[x]_i) / d(x_j)`.

In other words, the later latents we're differentiating are actually a function of the earlier SAE's residual stream reconstruction, rather than the actual residual stream. This is a bit risky when drawing conclusions from the results, because if your earlier SAE isn't very good at reconstructing its input then you might miss out on ways in which downstream latents are affected by upstream activations. A good way to sanity check this is to compare the latent activations (computed downstream of the earlier SAE's reconstructions) with the true latent activations, and make sure they're similar.\n",

        "Finally, we'll have you compute the latent-to-logit gradients. This exercise will be quite similar to the first one (i.e. the latent-to-latent gradients), but this time the function you pass through `jacrev` will map SAE activations to logits, rather than to a later SAE's latents. Note that we've given you the argument `k` to specify only a certain number of top logits to take gradients for (because otherwise you might be computing a large gradient matrix, which could cause an OOM error).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why are we bothering to compute latent-to-logit gradients in the first place? Well, one obvious answer is that it completes our end-to-end circuits picture (we've now got tokens -> latents -> other latents -> logits). But to give another answer, we can consider latents as having a dual nature: when looking back towards the input, they are **representations**, but when looking forward towards the logits, they are **actions**. We might expect sparsity in both directions, in other words not only should latents sparsely represent the activations produced by the input, they should also sparsely affect the gradients influencing the output. As you'll see when doing these exercises, this is partially the case, although not to the same degree as we saw extremely sparse token-to-latent or latent-to-latent gradients. One reason for that is that sparsity as representations is already included in the SAE's loss function (the L1 penalty), but there's no explicit penalty term to encourage sparsity in the latent gradients. Anthropic propose what this might look like in their [April 2024 update](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/april-update/index.html#attr-dl).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, despite the results for latent-to-logit gradients being less sparse than the last 2 exercises, they can still teach us a lot about which latents are important for a particular input prompt. Fill in the functions below, and then play around with some latent-to-logit gradients yourself!"

        "The MLP-layer SAEs we've looked at attempt to represent activations as a sparse linear combination of latent vectors; importantly, they only operate on activations **at a single point in the model**. They don't actually learn to perform the MLP layer's computation, rather they learn to reconstruct the results of that computation. It's very hard to do any weights-based analysis on MLP layers in superposition using standard SAEs, since many latents are highly dense in the neuron basis, meaning the neurons are hard to decompose.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, **transcoders** take in the activations before the MLP layer (i.e. the possibly-normalized residual stream values) and aim to represent the post-MLP activations of that MLP layer, again as a sparse linear combination of latent vectors. The transcoder terminology is the most common, although these have also been called **input-output SAEs** (because we take the input to some base model layer, and try to learn the output) and **predicting future activations** (for obvious reasons). Note that transcoders aren't technically autoencoders, because they're learning a mapping rather than a reconstruction - however a lot of our intuitions from SAEs carry over to transcoders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why might transcoders be an improvement over standard SAEs? Mainly, they offer a much clearer insight into the function of a model's layers. From the [Transcoders LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YmkjnWtZGLbHRbzrP/transcoders-enable-fine-grained-interpretable-circuit):\n",
        "\n",
        "> One of the strong points of transcoders is that they decompose the function of an MLP layer into sparse, independently-varying, and meaningful units (like neurons were originally intended to be before superposition was discovered). This significantly simplifies circuit analysis.\n",

SAEs are analogous to a debugger that lets us set breakpoints at various locations in the program and read out variables. On the other hand, transcoders are analogous to a tool for replacing specific subroutines in this program with human-interpretable approximations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuitively it might seem like transcoders are solving a different (more complicated) kind of optimization problem - trying to mimic the MLP's computation rather than just reproduce output - and so they would suffer a performance tradeoff relative to standard SAEs. However, evidence suggests that this might not be the case, and transcoders might offer a pareto improvement over standard SAEs."

The model we'll be working with has been trained to reconstruct the 8th MLP layer of GPT-2. An important note - we're talking about taking the normalized input to the MLP layer and outputting `mlp_out` (i.e. the values we'll be adding back to the residual stream).

        "\n",
        "In the exercises on latent-latent gradients at the start of this section, we saw that it could be quite difficult to compute how any 2 latents in different layers interact with each other. In fact, we could only compute gradients between latents which were both alive in the same forward pass. One way we might have liked to deal with this is by just taking the dot product of the \"writing vector\" of one latent with the \"reading vector\" of another. For example, suppose our SAEs were trained on post-ReLU MLP activations, then we could compute: `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1] @ W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` (where `f1` and `f2` are our earlier and later latent indices, `layer1` and `layer2` are our SAE layers, and `W_in`, `W_out` are the MLP input & output weight matrices for all layers). To make sense of this formula: the term `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1]` is the \"writing vector\" being added to the residual stream by the first (earlier) latent, and we would take the dot product of this with `W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` to compute the activation of the second (later) latent. However, one slight frustration is that we're ignoring the later MLP layer's ReLU function (remember that the SAEs are reconstructing the post-ReLU activations, not pre-ReLU). This might seem like a minor point, but it actually gets to a core part of the limitation of standard SAEs when trained on layers which perform computation - **the SAEs are reconstructing a snapshot in the model, but they're not helping us get insight into the layer's actual computation process**.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do transcoders help us here? Well, since transcoders sit around the entire MLP layer (nonlinearity and all), we can literally compute the dot product between the \"writing vector\" and a downstream \"reading vector\" to figure out whether any given latent causes another one to be activated (ignoring layernorm). To make a few definitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **pullback** of some later latent is $p = (W_{dec})^T f_{later}$, i.e. the dot product of the later latent vector (reading weight) with all the decoder weights (writing weights) of earlier latents.\n",
        "- The **de-embedding** is a special case: $d = W_E f_{later}$, i.e. instead of asking \"which earlier transcoder latents activate some later latent?\" we ask \"which tokens maximally activate some later latent?\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that we can in principle compute both of these quantities for regular MLP SAEs. But they wouldn't be as accurate to the model's actual computation, and so you couldn't draw as many strong conclusions from them.\n",
        "\n",
        "To complete our circuit picture of (embeddings -> transcoders -> unembeddings), it's worth noting that we can compute the logit lens for a transcoder latent in exactly the same way as regular SAEs: just take the dot product of the transcoder decoder vector with the unembedding matrix. Since this has basically the exact same justification & interpretation as for regular SAEs, we don't need to invent a new term for it, so we'll just keep calling it the logit lens!"

        "By **input-independent circuit analysis**, they mean things like pullbacks and de-embeddings (i.e. things which are a function of just the model & transcoder's weights). By **input-dependent**, they specifically mean the **input-dependent influence**, which they define to be the elementwise product of the pullback to some earlier transcoder and the post-ReLU activations of that earlier transcoder. In other words, it tells you not just which earlier latents would affect some later latent when those earlier latents fire, but which ones *do* affect the later latent on some particular input (i.e. taking into account which ones actually fired).\n",

        "What's the motivation for this? Well, eventually we want to be able to understand latents when they appear in complex circuits, not just as individual units which respond to specific latents in the data. And part of that should involve being able to build up hypotheses about what a given latent is doing based on only its connection to other latents (or to specific tokens in the input). Just looking directly at the top activating examples can definitely be helpful, but not only is it sometimes [misleading](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-latent-splitting-and), it also can only tell you *what* a latent is doing, without giving much insight into *why*.\n",

If you want an easier exercise then you can use a latent which the post successfully reverse-engineered (e.g. latent 355, the 300th live latent in the transcoder), but for a challenge you can also try latent 479 (the 400th live latent in the transcoder,which the authors weren't able to reverse-engineer in their initial post).\n",

This allows you to test your hypotheses in ways that still impose some restrictions on your action space."

However, it's important to consider many different lines of evidence when working with SAEs, because individual pieces of evidence can often be misleading, or less useful than others. For example, some latents can often make a lot more sense if they're viewed as part of a group that split from a single latent in a narrower SAE, whereas other latents will be insufficiently important to appear in narrower SAEs.

        "\n",
        "> One striking thing about the features we’ve found is that they appear in clusters. For instance, we observed above multiple base64 features, multiple Arabic script features, and so on. We see more of these features as we increase the total number of learned sparse features, a phenomenon we refer to as feature splitting. As we go from 512 features in A/0 to 4,096 features in A/1 and to 16,384 features in A/2, the number of features specific to base64 contexts goes from 1 to 3 to many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "They go on to analyze the feature splitting phenomenon in more detail by creating **2D UMAPs** of the combined set of latents from their different SAEs. [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. Anthropic observed some interesting geometric structure in their UMAPs, which seem to correspond to semantic structure in the latent space of the model (in other words, latents that have similar meanings also have small angles between their dictionary vectors).\n",

Note that this might take a while to run (up to about a minute), so don't worry if it's not immediate. If you like, you can test your function by editing it to only run on a small subset of the data (say, 100 latents), and then checking that the output looks sensible. Nowever, note that for our particular situation, the time taken for each UMAP should scale much slower than `O(n_data ** 2)`, so it should be possible to create maps from any of the SAEs you'll be loading in this section.\n",

The `n_neighbors` and `min_dist` arguments are hyperparameters of the UMAP algorithm, which control the trade off between local structure (how many neighbors each point has) and global structure (how far apart points are). You can see the `UMAP` docstrings for more on these. In the case of your 2D UMAP, you can use `n_neighbors_visual` and `min_dist_visual` as these arguments. See the next exercise for how the other arguments `n_neighbors_cluster` etc are used.\n",

The former should be the top 10 boosted tokens for each latent (i.e. the largest values when you pass the decoder matrix through the model's unembedding). The latter should be the autointerp description, taken from the corresponding dataframe in `autointerp_dfs` which is defined for you in the code above. These are both recommended, but optional - if you don't want to bother with this, then you can comment the field out of the `hoverdata` argument in the plotting function."

To quote from the paper, the phenomenon of feature absorption is as follows:\n",

        "> - An SAE latent appears to track a human-interpretable concept (such as \"starts with E\").\n",
        "> - That SAE latent fails to activate on seemingly arbitrary examples (eg \"Elephant\").\n",
        "> - We find \"absorbing\" latents which weakly project onto the feature direction and causally mediate in-place of the main latent (eg: an \"elephants\" latent absorbs the \"starts with E\" feature direction, and then the SAE no longer fires the \"starts with E\" latent on the token \"Elephant\", as the \"elephants\" latent now encodes that information, along with other semantic elephant-related features).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that feature absorption also complicates the picture of feature splitting we gave above. In the view of feature splitting, a single latent in a narrow SAE can split into multiple more specific latents in a wider SAE. In this picture, our ability to predict SAE activations is still good, and we should expect to find sparse circuits in our model. But feature absorption is a problem which still persists even at large SAE widths, and it might impair not only our ability to predict SAE activations, but also to find sparse circuits (because our SAE no longer gives is a decomposition with a sparse set of causal mediators). Furthermore, feature absorption seems like a problem which stems directly from the sparsity penalty (since it allows the \"starts with E\" feature to fire less, without making the \"Elephant\" feature fire more), making it very hard to fix.\n",

It turns out this is very hard, because any metric we pick is vulnerable to **Goodhearting** and not necessarily representative of what we want out of our SAEs. For example, it seems like sparser latents are often more interpretable (if reconstruction loss is held constant), which is why a common way to evaluate SAEs is along a **Pareto frontier of latent sparsity & reconstruction loss**. But what if sparsity doesn't lead to more interpretable latents (e.g. because of [feature absorption](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-feature-splitting-and))? **Autointerp provides an alternative way of evaluating SAE interpretability, because we can directly quantify how good our latent explanations are!** The idea is to convert latent explanations into a set of predictions on some test set of prompts, and then score the accuracy of those predictions. More interpretable latents should lead to better predictions, because the latents will tend to have monosemantic and human-interpretable patterns that can be predicted from their given explanations.\n",

        "These can be pretty difficult problems to solve. For example, in order to fix the problem of low precision, we'd need to exhibit example sequences containing the word \"stop\" in contexts other than \"don't stop\" or \"won't stop\", showing the model that the activations here are zero. Unfortunately, it's not obvious how to generate these false positive examples, because the sequences we're using in our autointerp are usually either sampled from the latent's top activating sequences (meaning they'll only contain \"stop\" inside phrases \"don't stop\" or \"won't stop\") or drawn randomly from the full dataset (in which case we shouldn't expect them to contain the word \"stop\" with particularly high frequency).

However, we'll be using a slightly easier-to-implement method: **detection**, i.e. giving the model a random sample of sequences (some of which are drawn from its top activating sequences, and others randomly from our dataset) and asking it to classify whether each sequence contains the latent in question. We can then measure the accuracy of its predictions - for example, if we pick 5 random sequences and 3 top activating sequences (ordered so that #1, #3, #7 are the top activating sequences), and our model predicted #1, #3, #6, then we'd have a score of 6/8 = 75% (since all sequences were correctly classified except for #6 and #7).\n",

        "\n",
        "This is a very barebones implementation of autointerp, and could be improved in a number of ways. We list a few below, you're welcome to try any of these as well as other ideas you can think of!\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use asyncio to speed up API queries.** The data gathering is parallelized across latents (most of the computation time is in the forward pass, not the for loop over latents to get max activations), but the same isn't true for querying the OpenAI API - this is currently implemented in a for loop, which is pretty inefficient. The operation of querying OpenAI's API is I/O bottlenecked, meaning you should be able to make it faster using libraries like `asyncio`. Can you get this working? (Note, this particular extension might not be well suited to working in a Colab or Jupyter notebook.)\n",
        "- **Use explanations for generation.** Can you set up a third pipeline (alongside generation & scoring) which takes in the explanations produced during the generation phase, and uses them to produce sequences which the model thinks is likely to cause the latent to activate (as described by EleutherAI [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/#:~:text=Generation)). Does your model produce false positives in these cases? If so, can you use those examples in your generation phase to improve your explanation precision, reducing the number of false positive classifications?\n",
        "- **Measure precision using latent neighbours.** Again as described by EleutherAI [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/#:~:text=Neighbors) - can you measure the precision of your explanations by finding latents with high decoder cosine similarity to each other, and seeing whether the explanation is sufficient to distinguish between whether a sequence activates one latent or the other? To take a different perspective, can you take top activating sequences from neighbouring latents, and use them as false positives in your generation phase to help improve the precision of your explanations?\n",
        "- **Benchmark autointerp against neurons / random latents.** Anthropic [found](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html#appendix-automated-setup) that autointerp on SAE latents consistently outperformed autointerp on transformer neurons or randomly initialized latents (which is a good sign for our SAE latents being interpretable and monosemantic!). However, they found that autointerp on randomized SAE latents performed better than one might expect, because even random latents will display patterns when you take the top-k over a very large dataset (e.g. always firing on the same token or something). Can you replicate these results? What do you think the results say about autointerp and SAEs as a whole?\n",
        "- **Incorporating more information.** Can you add to the generation prompt in ways suggested by EleutherAI, such as (1) adding the top logits boosted by this latent, (2) giving the quantized activation values for each token, (3) including example explanations in your prompt which illustrate the different kinds of latents you might encounter (e.g. token-level, substring-level, or concept-level with high consistent activation heuristic), or (4) using chain of thought to improve the quality of the model's explanations, for example:\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, we'll move on to **patch scoping**, an interesting new method for autointerp which promises to significantly cut down the compute costs of running autointerp on a very large set of SAE latents. To summarize, patch scoping involves taking a prompt like `\"The meaning of X is\"` and then generating output from the same model which the SAE was trained on, steering on the token `X` in the direction of the SAE latent. Effectively we're taking advantage of the model's own internal representations to get it to define a latent for us, as opposed to just using a different model to automate assessments of latents based on their activations.\n",

        "Instruction tuning is a technique for fine-tuning LLMs on a labeled dataset of instructional prompts and corresponding outputs. It improves model performance not only on specific tasks, but on following instructions in general. Note that instruction tuning is not the same thing as RLHF - it doesn't require any RL in the optimization process, it's just fine-tuning in the same way as you might have performed the fine-tuning exercises in the first chapter of ARENA material (when we studied image classifiers).\n",

        "- An instruction: A natural language text input that specifies a given task. For example, “translate this sentence from English to Spanish.”\n",
        "- Additional information: Optional, supplementary information that provides context relevant to the task at hand. For example, an input for a reading comprehension task might include a brief passage (and then instruct the model to answer a given question about it).\n",
        "- Desired output: The target output—response—for the given prompt, per the instructions and context provided. This will serve as a ground truth against which the model’s predictions are evaluated and optimized.\n",

Over the last twenty-five years, machines have beaten the best humans [...] There are holes in its education.

On the other hand, Lee Sedol can adjust his strategy based on his opponent's previous moves, but AlphaGo can't do so until it is retrained by its creators. Additionally, Lee Sedol was able to draw on his intuition and adapt to what he saw from his opponent in previous games, something AlphaGo can't do yet.

        "Training SAEs can be very challenging, and new insights are being rapidly discovered. From Joseph Bloom:\n",
        "\n",
        "> SAEs are an unsupervised method which attempts to trade off reconstruction accuracy against interpretability, which we achieve by inducing activation sparsity. Since we don’t have good metrics for interpretability / reconstruction quality, it’s hard to know when we are actually optimizing what we care about. On top of this, we’re trying to pick a good point on the pareto frontier between interpretability and reconstruction quality which is a hard thing to assess well. The main objective is to have your SAE learn a population of sparse latents (which are likely to be interpretable) without having some dense latents (latents which activate all the time and are likely uninterpretable) or too many dead latents (latents which never fire).\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to help us train SAEs, we've developed a large number of metrics which can be logged while we're training - we'll be discussing more of these later. Many of these metrics are also relevant when performing **SAE evaluations** - in other words, not trying to measure performance improvements during training, but trying to measure the performance of SAEs post-training in order to assess the beneficial impact of new SAE architectures or training techniques. However, we should be conscious of the fact that different considerations go into metrics for post-training evals vs metrics during training - in particular that post-training metrics only need to be computed once, but it's more important that they tell us a clear and detailed story. For example, techniques like autointerp scoring are promising measures of SAE interpretability, but in their current form are too costly to be performed during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important note before we move on - it's important to draw a distinction between **level 1 thinking** and **level 2 thinking**. In this context, level 1 thinking is about interpreting metrics at face value and trying to find training setups which lead to optimal tradeoffs / positions on the Pareto frontier. Level 2 is about asking whether these proxy objectives actually correspond to getting us the SAEs we want, or whether they'll come apart from each other in undesireable ways. For example, **feature absorption** is one potential issue in SAEs, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the sparsity penalty. However, these topics are mostly explored in chapter 3 of this material (where we take deep dives into topics like latent absorption, autointerp, latent splitting, etc) as well as the second half of this chapter (where we discuss evals post-training, rather than evals during training). In the first half of this chapter, most of the time you should be thinking at level 1."

This includes many of the parameters that went into the SAE config (in fact, this class contains a method `get_base_sae_cfg_dict()` which returns a dictionary that can be used to create the associated `SAEConfig` object). However, it also includes many other arguments which are specific to the training process itself. You can see the full set of config parameters in the source code for `LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig`, however for our purposes we can group them into ~7 main categories:\n",

        "1. **Data generation** - everything to do with how the data we use to train the SAE is generated & batched. Recall that your SAEs are trained on the activations of a base TransformerLens model, so this includes things like the model name (which should point to a model [supported by TransformerLens](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html)), hook point in the model, dataset path (which should reference a HuggingFace dataset), etc. We've also included `d_in` in this category since it's uniquely determined by the hook point you're training on.\n",
        "2. **SAE architecture** - everything to do with the SAE architecture, which isn't implied by the data generation parameters. This includes things like `d_sae` (which you are allowed to use, although in practice we often specify `expansion_factor` and then `d_sae` is defined as `d_in * expansion_factor`), which activation function to use, how our weights are initialized, whether we subtract the decoder bias `b_dec` from the input, etc.\n",
        "3. **Activations store** - everything to do with how the activations are stored and processed during training. Recall we used the `ActivationsStore` class earlier when we were generating the latent dashboards for our model. During training we also use an instance of this class to store and process batches of activations to feed into our SAE. We need to specify things like how many batches we want to store, how many prompts we want to process at once, etc.\n",
        "4. **Training hyperparameters (standard)** - these are the standard kinds of parameters you'd expect to see in an other ML training loop: learning rate & learning rate scheduling, betas for Adam optimizer, etc.\n",
        "5. **Training hyperparameters (SAE-specific)** - these are all the parameters which are specific to your SAE training. This means various coefficients like the $L_1$ penalty (as well as warmups for these coefficients), as well as things like the resampling protocol - more on this later. Certain other architectures (e.g. gated) might also come with additional parameters that need specifying.\n",
        "6. **Logging / evals** - these control how frequently we log data to Weights & Biases, as well as how often we perform evaluations on our SAE (more on evals in the second half of this exercise set!). Remember that when we talk about evals during training, we're often talking about different kinds of evals than we perform post-training to compare different SAEs to each other (although there's certainly a lot of overlap).\n",

To enable WandB, set `log_to_wandb=True`. The `wandb_project` parameter in the config controls the project name in WandB. You can also control the logging frequency with `wandb_log_frequency` and `eval_every_n_wandb_logs`. A number of helpful metrics are logged to WandB, including the sparsity of the SAE, the mean squared error (MSE) of the SAE, dead latents, and explained variance.

        "#### Reconstruction vs sparsity metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "As we've discussed, most metrics you log to WandB are attempts to measure either reconstruction loss or sparsity, in various different ways. The goal is to monitor how these two different objectives are being balanced, and hopefully find pareto-improvements for them! For reconstruction loss, you want to pay particular attention to **MSE loss**, **CE loss recovered** and **explained variance**. For sparsity, you want to look at the L0 and L1 statistics, as well as the activations histogram (more on that below, since it's more nuanced than \"brr line go up/down\"!).\n",
        "\n",
        "The L1 coefficient is the primary lever you have for managing the tradeoff between accurate reconstruction and sparsity. Too high and you get lots of dead latents (although this is mediated by L1 warmup if using a scheduler - see below), too low and your latents will be dense and polysemantic rather than sparse and interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another really important point when considering the tradeoff between these two metrics - it might be tempting to use a very high L1 coefficient to get nice sparse interpretable latents, but if this comes at a cost of high reconstruction loss, then there's a real risk that **you're not actually learning the model's true behaviour.** SAEs are only valuable when they give us a true insight into what the model's representations actually are, and doing interpretability without this risks being just a waste of time. See discussion [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tEPHGZAb63dfq2v8n/how-useful-is-mechanistic-interpretability) between Neel Nanda, Ryan Greenblat & Buck Schlegris for more on this point (note that I don't agree with all the points made in this post, but it raises some highly valuable ideas that SAE researchers would do well to keep in mind).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ...but metrics can sometimes be misleading\n",
        "\n",
        "Although metrics in one of these two groups will often tell a similar story (e.g. explained variance will usually be high when MSE loss is small), they can occasionally detach, and it's important to understand why this might happen. Some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- L0 and L1 both tell you about sparsity, but latent shrinkage makes them detach (it causes smaller L1, not L0)\n",
        "- MSE loss and KL div / downstream CE both tell you about reconstruction, but they detach because one is myopic and the other is not\n",
        "\n",
        "As well as being useful to understand these specific examples, it's valuable to put yourself in a skeptical mindset, and understand why these kinds of problems can arise. New metrics are being developed all the time, and some of them might be improvements over current ones while others might carry entirely new and unforseen pitfalls!\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dead latents, resampling & ghost gradients\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dead latents** are ones that never fire on any input. These can be a big problem during training, because they don't receive any gradients and so represent permanently lost capacity in your SAE. Two ways of dealing with dead latents, which Anthropic have described in various papers and update posts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Ghost gradients** - this describes the method of adding an additional term to the loss, which essentially gives dead latents a gradient signal that pushes them in the direction of explaining more of the autoencoder's residual. Full technical details [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/jan-update/index.html#dict-learning-resampling).\n",
        "2. **Resampling** - at various timesteps we take all our dead latents and randomly re-initialize them to values which help explain more of the residual (specifically, we will randomly select inputs which the SAE fails to reconstruct, and then set dead featurs to be the SAE hidden states corresponding to those inputs).\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques are both useful, however they've been reassessed in the time after they were initially introduced, and are now not seen to be as critical as they once were (especially [ghost grads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/march-update/index.html#dl-update)). Instead, we use more standard techniques to avoid dead latents, specifically a combination of an appropriately small learning rate and an L1 warmup. We generally recommend people use resampling and not ghost gradients, but to take enough care with your LR and L1 warmup to avoid having to rely on resampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assuming we're not using ghost gradients, resampling is controlled by the following 3 parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `feature_sampling_window`, which is how often we resample neurons\n",
        "- `dead_feature_window`, which is the size of the window over which we count dead latents each time we resample. This should be smaller than `feature_sampling_window`\n",
        "- `dead_feature_threshold`, which is the threshold below which we consider a latent to be dead & resample it\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dense latents & learning rates\n",
        "\n",
        "Dense latents are the opposite problem to dead latents: if your learning rate is too small or L1 penalty too small, you'll fail to train latents to the point of being sparse. A dense latent is one that fires too frequently (e.g. on >1/100 or even >1/10 tokens). These latents seem generally uninterpretable, but can help with youre reconstruction loss immensely - essentially it's a way for the SAEs to smuggle not-particularly-sparse possibly-nonlinear computation into your SAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be difficult to balance dense and dead latents during training. Generally you want to drop your learning rate as far down as it will go, without causing your latents to be dense and your training to be super slow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note - what (if any) the right number of dense or dead latents should be in any situation is very much an open question, and depends on your beliefs about the underlying latent distribution in question. One way we can investigate this question is to try and train SAEs in a simpler domain, where the underlying latents are easier to guess about (e.g. OthelloGPT, or TinyStories - both of which we'll discuss later in this chapter).\n",

In order to make this easier to operationalize, I’ve drawn a diagram that captures my sense of the issues these histograms help you diagnose. Latent density histograms can be broken down into:\n",
        "> - **Too Dense**:  dense latents will occur at a frequency > 1 / 100. Some dense-ish latents are likely fine (such as a latent representing that a token begins with a space) but too many is likely an issue.\n",
        "> - **Too Sparse**: Dead latents won’t be sampled so will turn up at log10(epsilon), for epsilon added to avoid logging 0 numbers. Too many of these mean you’re over penalizing with L1.\n",
        "> - **Just-Right**: Without too many dead or dense latents, we see a distribution that has most mass between -5 or -4 and -3 log10 latent sparsity. The exact range can vary depending on the model / SAE size but the dense or dead latents tend to stick out.\n",

A pre-tokenized dataset is one that has already been tokenized & batched for all subsequent training runs. This will speed up SAE training, because you don't need to tokenize the dataset on the fly. See [this tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/pretokenizing_datasets.ipynb) for information on how to pre-tokenize your own dataset, if the one you're working with isn't pre-tokenized. However for now we don't need to worry about that, because ours is pre-tokenized. You can find a non-exhaustive list of pre-tokenized datasets [here](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/docs/training_saes.md#list-of-pretokenized-datasets).\n",

For each of these, we'll provide some tips on training, and how we recommend you approach them differently based on the specifics of what it is you're training.

The first one (Run #0) is a \"good\" training run (at least compared to the others), and can be thought of as a baseline. Each of the other 6 runs (labelled Run #1 - Run #6) has some particular issue with it. Your task will be to identify the issue (i.e. from one or more of the metrics plots), and find the root cause of the issue from looking at the configs (you can compare the configs to each other in the \"runs\" tab). Note that we recommend trying to identify the issue from the plots first, rather than immediately jumping to the config and looking for a diff between it and the good run. You'll get most value out of the exercises by using the following pattern when assessing each run:\n",

You can jump back to the section on GemmaScope (immediately before feature steering) to both review what the Gemma model series is, and also get a sense of the GemmaScope architecture (which should help guide your own architectural choices). Reminder that you can find a list of suitable pretokenized datasets for various different models [here](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/docs/training_saes.md#list-of-pretokenized-datasets).\n",

        "\n",
        "[OthelloGPT](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.5.3]_OthelloGPT) is a model that was trained to predict legal moves in Othello. It's an interesting domain for studying SAEs, because it's simpler than most natural language datasets, but it's also more complex than the vast majority of toy problems (because to track which squares are legal, you have to keep track of a large number of possible captures and recaptures). Furthermore, [research by Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/othello) strongly suggests that OthelloGPT contains a linear board state model, which means:\n",
        "\n",
        "- We might expect SAEs trained on the residual stream to be able to extract these board state representations,\n",
        "- We might expect SAEs trained on MLP layers or attention outputs to capture some computation that is performed on / used to create these linear representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training & exploring SAEs on OthelloGPT would make a really exciting project, since it serves as a good testbed for applying lots of new techniques in SAE interpretability (including many of the ones we've discussed earlier in these exercises). We've included some sample code to train a model below; again it's probably quite under-optimized and you're invited to try various methods of improving it (or trying it on different layers / different parts of the base model)."

        "> There's also a new SAELens tutorial [here](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/improving-evals/tutorials/evaluating_saes_with_sae_lens_evals.ipynb), which looks at several different metrics we covered while talking about training, but takes some deeper dives (e.g. looking at distributions of log latent density, and the **consistent activation heuristic**). We recommend anyone interested in evals have a look through this notebook.\n",
